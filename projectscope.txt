Differentiation

Bet types offered

Name 

Forecash

Colors: 

A light blue and purple color

blue #3F64F2
purple #7D47E6


market functionality

- there are four buttons at the top of the page
    - all
    - Politics
    - hollywood
    - sports

- when the user clicks on a button, the page will filter the markets by the category
- category is defined by the market type class
- the background color of the button should change to "white" for the active class
- the background color of the button should change to var()"light blue" for the inactive class


Login functionality

- login button in header
- when user clicks this button, a modal will appear
- the modal will have a form with two inputs
    - email
    - password

- the modal will have a button that says "login"
- when the user clicks this button, the modal will close and the user will be logged in

- the modal will have a button that says "sign up"

Things to consider 

- how to handle the user's account balance
- how to handle the user's bets
- how to handle the user's account information

How to handle the user's account information (things I don't know)

- i don't know where the information gets sent when a user signs up or logs in
- i don't know how to store user information securely 

Things I need to do

- implement hashing for passwords
    * hashing is a way to encrypt passwords, creates fixed-length sequence of random characters
    * hashing is a one way function
    * hashing is a deterministic function
    * hashing is a function that takes in a string and returns a string


How it's done

1. create index.php, login.php, register.php, and logout.php
2. create a database called "users" in php admin and a table with names
3. create a form in index.php with email and password inputs
4. create a form in register.php with email, password, and password confirmation inputs
